    "content": "#  Purple Canary 🐦‍⬛\n\n**A Pi-hole plugin for detecting Pegasus spyware and commercial surveillance tools**\n\nPurple Canary transforms your Pi-hole into a network sensor that monitors DNS queries for known indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with Pegasus spyware and other commercial surveillance tools. By deploying distributed sensors across civil society, we increase the operational costs for spyware vendors and reduce the window of opportunity for zero-day exploits.\n\n## WiP, Status: Just initiated\n\n4.1.2026: Structure and WBS created\n\n## 🎯 Mission\n\nCommercial spyware like NSO Group's Pegasus has been used to target journalists, human rights defenders, and activists worldwide. While reactive detection cannot prevent zero-day exploits, widespread deployment of network sensors serves multiple strategic purposes:\n\n- **Economic pressure**: Forces attackers to rotate infrastructure more frequently, increasing operational costs\n- **Rapid attribution**: Enables faster identification and documentation of new attack campaigns\n- **Deterrence**: Makes surveillance operations more visible and risky, particularly against lower-priority targets\n- **Community defense**: Creates a distributed early warning system for civil society organizations\n\n## 🔍 What is Pegasus?\n\nPegasus is sophisticated spyware developed by NSO Group that can compromise iOS and Android devices through:\n\n- **Zero-click exploits**: No user interaction required, exploiting vulnerabilities in iMessage, WhatsApp, Apple Music, and iOS Photos\n- **Network injection**: Attacks via compromised mobile operators or rogue cell towers\n- **Spear-phishing**: Malicious SMS messages with embedded links\n\nOnce installed, Pegasus provides complete device access including messages, calls, camera, microphone, and location data.\n\n## 📊 Data Sources\n\nPurple Canary integrates indicators of compromise from leading digital rights organizations:\n\n- **Amnesty International's Security Lab**: Technical investigations and IoC lists from documented cases\n- **Citizen Lab (University of Toronto)**: Research on targeted surveillance and NSO Group infrastructure\n- **Community contributions**: Additional indicators from security researchers and civil society\n\nAll IoCs are automatically synced from trusted sources and updated regularly.\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n### Core Functionality\n- 🔄 **Automatic IoC updates** from Amnesty International and Citizen Lab repositories\n- 🔎 **Real-time DNS query monitoring** against known Pegasus/spyware domains\n- 🚨 **Configurable alerts** via ntfy.sh, email, Telegram, or Slack\n- 📝 **Forensic logging** with timestamps, affected devices, and IoC sources\n- 🛡️ **Privacy-focused** - all monitoring happens locally, no data leaves your network\n\n### Optional Features\n- 📊 Web dashboard for visualization of detected queries\n- 📤 Export functionality for forensic analysis (CSV/JSON)\n- 🐳 Docker container support for easy deployment\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/purple-canary.git\ncd purple-canary\n\n# Run the installer\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n# Configure alerts (optional)\nsudo nano /etc/purple-canary/config.yml\n\n# Start monitoring\nsudo systemctl enable --now purple-canary\n```\n\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n- Pi-hole v5.x or v6.x\n- Debian/Ubuntu-based system (Raspberry Pi OS, DietPi, etc.)\n- Python 3.8+ or Bash 4.0+\n- Root/sudo access\n\n\n## 🔔 Alert Configuration\n\nPurple Canary supports multiple notification channels:\n\n```yaml\nalerts:\n  enabled: true\n  channels:\n    - type: ntfy\n      url: https://ntfy.sh/your-topic\n    - type: email\n      smtp_server: smtp.example.com\n      recipient: security@example.org\n```\n\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nThis is a community-driven project. We welcome contributions of all kinds:\n\n- **IoC sources**: Know of additional threat intelligence feeds?\n- **Code improvements**: Bug fixes, new features, optimizations\n- **Documentation**: Translations, tutorials, case studies\n- **Testing**: Report issues or test on different Pi-hole configurations\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.\n\n## ⚠️ Limitations\n\n**Important**: Purple Canary is a reactive detection system. It can only detect known IoCs that have been documented and published. It provides:\n\n- ✅ Detection of historical and documented spyware infrastructure\n- ✅ Attribution and documentation of attempted connections\n- ✅ Community early warning when infrastructure is reused\n\nIt does **not** provide:\n\n- ❌ Protection against new zero-day exploits\n- ❌ Detection of unknown Command \\& Control servers\n- ❌ Prevention of device compromise\n- ❌ Complete security against targeted surveillance\n\nThink of Purple Canary as one layer in a defense-in-depth strategy, not a complete solution.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n\n- [Amnesty International: Forensic Methodology Report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/)\n- [Citizen Lab: NSO Group Research](https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group/)\n- [AmnestyTech IoC Repository](https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations)\n- [Mobile Verification Toolkit](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt)\n\n\n## 📄 License\n\n[Apache 2.0](LICENSE) or [GPL-3.0](LICENSE-GPL) - choose the license that works best for your use case.\n\n## 🙏 Acknowledgments\n\n- Amnesty International's Security Lab for forensic research and IoC publication\n- Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto for surveillance research\n- The Pi-hole community for building essential privacy infrastructure\n- All journalists, activists, and human rights defenders who contributed to exposing commercial surveillance\n\n\n## ⚖️ Ethical Use\n\nThis tool is designed to protect civil society from unlawful surveillance.

    "content": "# Contributing to Purple Canary\n\nThank you for your interest in Purple Canary! This project is in its early stages, and we're figuring things out as we go. Your contributions are welcome, and we'll keep the process simple and pragmatic.\n\n## 🏗️ Project Status\n\nPurple Canary is a **project in development**. Processes, conventions, and governance structures are still being established. Don't worry about getting everything perfect - we'll figure it out together.\n\n## 🤝 How You Can Help\n\n### 1. Code Contributions\n\nWe're building the core functionality from scratch. Here's what we need:\n\n- **IoC integration scripts**: Fetching and parsing indicators from Amnesty International, Citizen Lab, and other sources\n- **Query monitoring**: Python/Bash scripts to watch Pi-hole's FTL database for suspicious DNS queries\n- **Alert systems**: Integration with ntfy.sh, email, Telegram, or other notification channels\n- **Installation scripts**: Making deployment as simple as possible\n- **Testing**: Trying Purple Canary on different Pi-hole versions and system configurations\n\n**Getting started**: Just fork the repo, create a branch, and submit a PR. We'll review and discuss together.\n\n### 2. Threat Intelligence\n\nKnow of additional IoC sources beyond Amnesty International and Citizen Lab?\n\n- New spyware vendor domains or IP ranges\n- Additional research publications with technical indicators\n- Trusted threat intelligence feeds relevant to commercial surveillance tools\n\n**Share it**: Open an issue with the source details and we'll evaluate integration.\n\n### 3. Documentation\n\n- **Translations**: Help make Purple Canary accessible in languages beyond English and German\n- **Tutorials**: Write guides for specific Pi-hole setups (Docker, Proxmox LXC, DietPi, etc.)\n- **Use cases**: Document how Purple Canary is deployed in NGOs, newsrooms, or research environments\n- **Troubleshooting**: Help us build a knowledge base as issues arise\n\n### 4. Testing & Bug Reports\n\nFound a bug? Have an idea? Open an issue on GitHub:\n\n- Describe what happened and what you expected\n- Include your Pi-hole version and OS (e.g., \"Pi-hole v5.18 on Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm\")\n- Share relevant logs if possible (redact sensitive information)\n- Screenshots or terminal output are helpful\n\nNo need for formal bug report templates yet - just tell us what's going on.\n\n### 5. Ideas & Feedback\n\nThis project exists to serve civil society organizations, journalists, and individuals concerned about surveillance. If you have ideas about:\n\n- Additional features that would be useful\n- Different deployment scenarios we should support\n- Privacy or security considerations we haven't addressed\n- Partnerships with organizations doing similar work\n\nOpen an issue or start a discussion. All input is valuable.\n\n## 💻 Technical Guidelines\n\nSince we're still establishing conventions, here are some loose guidelines:\n\n### Code Style\n- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 where reasonable, but readability > strict adherence\n- **Bash**: Use shellcheck to catch common issues\n- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what* - the code shows what it does\n\n### Commits\n- Write meaningful commit messages (a one-line summary is fine)\n- No need for formal conventional commit format yet\n\n### Dependencies\n- Prefer standard library and tools already available on most Pi-hole systems\n- Minimize external dependencies where possible\n- Document any new dependencies clearly\n\n### Privacy & Security\nThis is non-negotiable:\n\n- **No telemetry**: Purple Canary does not phone home or collect usage data\n- **Local-only processing**: All detection happens on the user's network\n- **Secure defaults**: Logs should be readable only by root, alerts should use encrypted channels\n- **Data minimization**: Only log what's necessary for detection and forensics\n\n## 🔐 Security Issues\n\nFound a security vulnerability? Please **do not** open a public issue.\n\nFor now, email the maintainer directly (we'll set up a proper disclosure process soon). Include:\n- Description of the vulnerability\n- Steps to reproduce\n- Potential impact\n- Any suggested fixes\n\nWe'll work with you to address it responsibly.\n\n## 📜 License\n\nBy contributing to Purple Canary, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project (Apache 2.0 or GPL-3.0, dual-licensed).\n\nIf you're submitting code you didn't write yourself, make sure you have the right to contribute it.\n\n## 🌍 Community Guidelines\n\nKeep it simple:\n\n- **Be respectful**: We're all here to fight surveillance, not each other\n- **Be patient**: Maintainers are volunteers with day jobs\n- **Be constructive**: Criticism is welcome, but offer solutions when possible\n- **Be inclusive**: Purple Canary is for everyone concerned about surveillance\n\n## 📞 Getting in Touch\n\n- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs, feature requests, and technical discussions\n- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions, ideas, and general conversation (once enabled)\n- **Email**: [coming soon - we need to set up a project email]\n\n## 🙏 Thank You\n\n\n"

If you need to build on top of it to correct\n   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\n   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\n   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\n\n * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\n   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\n\nThe script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\nto be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\n$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\n\nWith this workflow, you would want to know:\n\n(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\n    not want to rewind it.\n\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\n    tip of \"master\".\n\nLet's look at this example:\n\n\t\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\n\t\t  /       /           /           /\n\t\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\n\t\t/   /               /           /\n\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\n\t      /   /   /             \\         /\n\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /\n\t    /   /   /   /             \\     /\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\n\n\nA, B and C are topic branches.\n\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\n\n * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to \"master\" and \"next\",\n   and is ready to be deleted.\n\n * C has not merged to \"next\" at all.\n\nWe would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage\nB to be deleted.\n\nTo compute (1):\n\n\tgit rev-list ^master ^topic next\n\tgit rev-list ^master        next\n\n\tif these match, topic has not merged in next at all.\n\nTo compute (2):\n\n\tgit rev-list master..topic\n\n\tif this is empty, it is fully merged to \"master\".\n\nDOC_END\n"
